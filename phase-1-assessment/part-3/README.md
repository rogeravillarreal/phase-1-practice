# Part 3: Object-Oriented Design

## Summary

In Part 3 of the assessment, we'll refactor some provided code for reusability.
Each class in the application has been tested for its behaviors.  When these
classes were written, knowledge about our application was often times
duplicated in multiple places; in other words, the code is not DRY.

Note: Redbox and Gamefly are some common media kiosk brands.  Media kiosks
allow you to rent media like books, video games, DVDs, etc. You'll often
find them located in or outside of convenience stores, grocery stores, and
fast-food restaurants.

## Running the Tests

If you have questions on how to run the tests, please check the
[rspec-help](../rspec-help.md) document.

## Release 0: Improve Design

Take a moment to review the classes and the corresponding behaviors. Now ask  yourself:
* What code smells can you identify?
* What are ways that you can remove these smells while keeping the intended behavior?

Think big picture.  Look at the classes side-by-side.  Don't worry about renaming methods and other minutiae.  This part of the assessment is completed when you've designed the code as best you know how.

Be sure that all tests continue to pass.  Do not modify the tests.

## Conclusion

Once you've made all the changes that you find improve the code, you have
completed Part 3 of the assessment.  If you haven't done so already, commit
your changes and move on to Part 4.
